# The Pantry Pal App
The main focus of this app is to provide a basic inventory system that can be assigned to containers (such as freezers,cupboards,etc). Users can create accounts that then can populate different "storages" that represent inventories (Freezer,Fridge<Cupboard...).
There is also a message and notification system more geared towards a user environment where there are various levels of staff, such as Owner as Admin, Manager as a Level 2 account and Clerks as Level 1 Users.

Level 1 Users can only view recipes, see notifications, use the messenger and adjust Item amounts in storages.
Level 2 Users can create, edit and delete storages along with their contents. Add recipes through a reich text editor or view random recipes. Plus everything else a level 1 can do.
Level 3 User also called Admin is created by default and as of now can only have this one level 3 account. The Admin account can create and edit other users along with what level 2 users can do.

## Steps To Use

1. Go to the Login page, https://gyro-trix.github.io/pantry-pal/#/login

Here you can either go to the Register page that allows you to create a Level 2 User, or sign in with one of the following accounts created by default:
- Username & Password: Admin      Level 3 User, access to all functions
- Username & Password: Demo2      Level 2 User, cannot create or edit users
- Username & Password: Demo1      Level 1 User, only can adjust amounts in storages

Also please note the Icon in the upper right (to the left of user on Navbar if logged in) which is used to change from light and dark themes.
